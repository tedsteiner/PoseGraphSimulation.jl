PoseGraphSimulation.jl
======================

Pose graph simulation for vehicles driving in street networks, utilizing the Julia OpenStreetMap.jl Package.

The associated ICRA paper describing the methodology was accepted and the final version has been submitted. I will upload the code as soon as I have a chance to clean it up, but if someone wants it sooner than May/June 2015 just open an issue so I know to prioritize it.
